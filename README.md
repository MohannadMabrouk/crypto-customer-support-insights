# Analyzing CSAT, SLA, Escalation, and Performance Metrics for Root Cause Improvement

## Description
This project analyzes **12,000+ crypto customer service tickets** to uncover insights that explain poor CSAT performance and identify root causes behind customer dissatisfaction. It mimics a real-world business analysis scenario where support teams aim to improve customer satisfaction, response time, escalation handling, and operational efficiency

## Objectives
✔ Identifying causes of bad surveys (CSAT ≤ 3)
✔ Analyzing agent performance and workload impact
✔ Discovering which ticket categories and countries produce unhappy customers
✔ Finding trends in SLA violation, escalation, severity, and user type
✔ Recommending CSAT improvement strategies

## Business Problem
Customer Support teams in crypto companies receive a high volume of tickets related to P2P, withdrawal, verification, trading, blockchain transfers, security settings, and more. The **project goal** is to identify which factors contribute to poor customer satisfaction, so managers can improve training, operations, product support, and resolution efficiency.
